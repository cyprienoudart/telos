# AGENTS.md — Cross-Iteration Knowledge Base

Accumulated learnings from the build process. The orchestrator appends to this file after each iteration. Subagents should read it before starting work.

## Conventions

<!-- Coding standards, naming conventions, patterns the project follows -->

## Gotchas

<!-- Things that went wrong and how they were fixed. Denial reasons from the reviewer. -->

## Patterns

<!-- Reusable patterns discovered during implementation (e.g., "all API routes use X middleware") -->

## Key Decisions

<!-- Architecture or design decisions made during implementation that future iterations should respect -->
