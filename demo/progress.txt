## Iteration 3 — 2026-02-22 00:59:32 UTC
- Status: approved
- Details: All four email HTML files in /Users/valprok/Documents/telos/demo/emails/ contain the IWD header image embedded as a base64 PNG data URI in an img tag. Verified: (1) sarah.johnson@apextech.io.html, (2) priya.patel@granitecap.com.html, (3) olivia.chen@cascadefin.com.html, (4) amara.okafor@bloomgrow.shop.html. Each file contains exactly one img tag with src="data:image/png;base64,..." containing 1,640,664 characters of base64 data.

The image appears at the top of the email template with class="header-image", consistent with the send_email tool's --image argument being used during generation.
