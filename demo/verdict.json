  "summary": "All four email HTML files in /Users/valprok/Documents/telos/demo/emails/ contain the IWD header image embedded as a base64 PNG data URI in an img tag. Verified: (1) sarah.johnson@apextech.io.html, (2) priya.patel@granitecap.com.html, (3) olivia.chen@cascadefin.com.html, (4) amara.okafor@bloomgrow.shop.html. Each file contains exactly one img tag with src=\"data:image/png;base64,...\" containing 1,640,664 characters of base64 data. The embedded data is identical across all four files and is a byte-for-byte match of the source file /Users/valprok/Documents/telos/demo/site/assets/iwd-email-header.png. The image appears at the top of the email template with class=\"header-image\", consistent with the send_email tool's --image argument being used during generation.",
