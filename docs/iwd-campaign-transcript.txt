North Star: Launch an International Women's Day marketing campaign across the company's digital channels to celebrate women clients and strengthen relationships.

Summary: Generate AI-powered images with an International Women's Day theme, update the company landing page with celebratory content, and send personalized congratulatory emails to women clients who have completed deals with us.

---

Q: What is the campaign about and when does it launch?
A: It's an International Women's Day (IWD) campaign for March 8th. The tone is warm, celebratory, and professional — not political or preachy. We want to honor women in business who are our clients and partners. Think "congratulations on your achievements" rather than generic IWD messaging.

Q: What images do we need for the campaign?
A: Three types of images, all in a consistent visual style — modern, warm, professional with purple and gold accents (IWD colors):
1. A hero banner (16:9 aspect ratio) for the landing page — elegant, abstract design celebrating women in business
2. A social media image (1:1 aspect ratio) — shareable IWD graphic with the company brand feel
3. An email header image (16:9 but smaller) — a warm, congratulatory header for the email campaign
All images should be generated using the image_gen CLI tool: `uv run python -m telos_agent.tools.image_gen`. Save all generated images to `demo/site/assets/`.

Q: What changes should be made to the landing page?
A: The landing page lives at `demo/site/index.html`. We need to:
1. Add an IWD banner strip at the very top of the page (purple gradient with gold text)
2. Replace the hero section's image placeholder with the generated hero banner
3. Add a new "International Women's Day" section below the hero — a card with the IWD message, the social image, and a call to action
4. Keep all existing content intact — this is additive, not a redesign
The site assets are in `demo/site/assets/`.

Q: Who should receive the emails and how do we find them?
A: The email targets are women contacts from our CRM who have deals in the "Won" pipeline stage. Query the Twenty CRM (available via MCP tools or REST API at http://localhost:3020) to:
1. Find all opportunities with stage "WON"
2. Get the linked contacts (pointOfContact)
3. Filter to women contacts
The CRM has been pre-seeded with demo data using the seed script. The Won deals linked to women contacts include Sarah Johnson, Priya Patel, Olivia Chen, and Amara Okafor.

Q: What should the emails contain?
A: Each email should:
- Be personalized with the recipient's first name
- Have a congratulatory subject line (e.g., "Celebrating You This International Women's Day!")
- Include the AI-generated email header image at the top
- Have a warm body message thanking them for their partnership and celebrating their achievements
- Be professional but heartfelt — not a sales pitch
Use the mock email tool: `uv run python -m telos_agent.tools.send_email`. It renders emails as HTML files in the output directory.

Q: Where should the email output go?
A: All rendered email HTML files go to `demo/emails/`. Each file is named by the recipient's email address (e.g., `sarah.johnson@apextech.io.html`).

Q: What tools and APIs are available?
A: The agents have access to:
- **Image generation**: `uv run python -m telos_agent.tools.image_gen "prompt" -o output.png` with `--aspect-ratio` and `--size` flags
- **Email rendering**: `uv run python -m telos_agent.tools.send_email --to "Name <email>" --subject "..." --body "..." --image path.png --output-dir demo/emails/`
- **CRM access**: Twenty CRM MCP tools (preferred) or REST API at http://localhost:3020. Use `TWENTY_API_KEY` env var for authentication.
- **File editing**: Standard Read/Write/Edit tools for modifying the landing page HTML

Q: Is there a specific order the work should happen in?
A: Yes — images first (other tasks depend on them), then the landing page update and emails can happen in parallel:
1. Generate all three IWD images (hero, social, email header) — save to `demo/site/assets/`
2. Update the landing page with the hero banner and new IWD section
3. Query CRM for women contacts with Won deals, then send congratulatory emails with the email header image

Q: Any other requirements or constraints?
A: Keep it simple and demo-friendly. This is a showcase of the multi-agent system, so the focus is on the agents correctly using the tools and producing visible output. The landing page should look good when opened in a browser. The emails should be well-formatted HTML. The images should be visually consistent. No actual emails are sent — everything is local files.
