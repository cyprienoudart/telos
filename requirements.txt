# Core dependencies for ALI model (Mac/CPU compatible)
# For GPU training, also install: torch with CUDA, bitsandbytes

# No heavy ML deps needed for hackathon mode
# The model runs with template-based generation + heuristic scoring
# When ready for real training, uncomment the GPU section below

# --- Always needed ---
sentence-transformers>=2.7.0
scikit-learn>=1.4.0

# --- For real model training (uncomment when GPU available) ---
transformers>=4.40.0
peft>=0.10.0
torch>=2.0.0
datasets>=2.18.0
accelerate>=0.28.0
trl>=0.8.0
protobuf>=3.20.0

# --- GPU only (requires Python >= 3.10) ---
# bitsandbytes>=0.43.0
