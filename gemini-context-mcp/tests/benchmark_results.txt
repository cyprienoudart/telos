       the system is deployed using Docker Compose and Kubernetes.
      ⏱ 11 ms

  Q 3: What are the main external dependencies?
   A: Project Telos relies on several external tools and technologies to
       function properly. The system uses Python 3.13 and FastAPI
       for its core logic, while PostgreSQL and Redis are used to
       store and manage data. For deployment and operations, it
       uses Docker Compose, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions.
       Additionally, sensitive information is managed using a tool
       called Vault.
      ⏱ 12 ms

  Q 4: How do you install and run this project?
   A: To run this project locally, you first need to copy the example
       environment file to a new file named dot env and fill in
       your database and secret keys. Next, use Docker Compose to
       start the database and Redis services. You then install the
       necessary software requirements using the pip install
       command. Finally, you can start the application by running
       the uvicorn command provided in the documentation.
      ⏱ 13 ms

  Q 5: What is the folder or module structure?
   A: Project Telos is organized into two main directories called docs
       and codebase. The docs folder contains reference
       documentation, team information, and project priorities.
       The codebase folder is divided into subdirectories for the
       application entry point, authentication handling, and data
       models. This structure helps manage the platform's research
       workflows and technical components in a clear way.
      ⏱ 18 ms

  Q 6: How is authentication or access control handled?
   A: Authentication is handled by a security layer that checks for a
       valid digital token in the header of every request to
       protected areas. If the token is missing, expired, or
       invalid, the system blocks the request and returns an error
       message. Access control is managed through a hierarchy of
       roles, where users like admins have more permissions than
       members or viewers. Additionally, the system can lock an
       account if there are ten failed login attempts in a row to
       keep it safe. For extra security, the system also tracks
       and rotates refresh tokens to detect and prevent
       unauthorized reuse of a session.
      ⏱ 31 ms

  Q 7: What database or storage technology is used?
   A: Project Telos uses PostgreSQL and Redis for its storage needs.
       These technologies are part of the platform's technical
       stack used to manage research workflows. Additionally, the
       project uses Vault to securely store production secrets.
      ⏱ 23 ms

  Q 8: How are errors and exceptions handled?
   A: The system handles errors by returning a JSON response that
       includes a specific error message and a 401 status code.
       For example, it will notify the user if their authorization
       header is missing, if their token has expired, or if the
       token is otherwise invalid. Additionally, the system logs
       warnings when refresh tokens are not found or when security
       issues like token reuse are detected. If a security risk is
       found, the system can also revoke access for an entire
       group of related tokens.
      ⏱ 17 ms

  Q 9: What tests exist and how do you run them?
   A: The provided excerpts do not contain information about what tests
       exist or how to run them.

  Q10: What environment variables or config files are required?
   A: To run the project, you need to create a configuration file named
       .env by copying the provided .env.example file. This file
       must be filled with specific information, including your
       database URL, Redis URL, and a secret key. It is important
       to remember that these secrets should never be shared or
       committed to the project's public history. For the
       production version of the app, these secrets are managed
       securely using a tool called Vault.

  Q 5: What is the folder or module structure?
   A: The project structure includes a variety of dependency and output
       directories such as node_modules, bower_components, and
       build/Release. It also contains specific folders for
       different frameworks, including .next for Next.js, .nuxt
       for Nuxt.js, and .svelte-kit for SvelteKit. Additionally,
       there are directories for configuration and cache, such as
       .serverless, .firebase, and .docusaurus.
      ⏱ 58 ms

  Q 6: How is authentication or access control handled?
   A: Authentication is handled by a middleware function that identifies
       users based on their unique Telegram ID. If a user does not
       already exist in the database, the system automatically
       creates a new profile for them using their Telegram
       information. For data security, the system uses Row Level
       Security policies that currently allow all operations on
       the database tables. Access to the database also requires
       specific environment variables like a service role key and
       an anonymous key.
      ⏱ 68 ms

  Q 7: What database or storage technology is used?
   A: The project uses a PostgreSQL database through the Supabase
       platform, which includes features like connection pooling
       and row-level security. It also mentions the use of a local
       SQLite database file located at database/bot.db.
       Additionally, the documentation suggests using Redis for
       caching frequently accessed data to improve performance.
      ⏱ 55 ms

  Q 8: How are errors and exceptions handled?
   A: When errors occur, the system uses a try-catch method to stop the
       process and log a specific error message to the console for
       debugging. If a problem happens during a database
       operation, the system throws the error to ensure it is
       handled properly. For web-related errors, the system saves
       a log of the failure and sends a response back with a
       status code and a description of what went wrong. In some
       cases, the system also logs the error message in a specific
       color to make it easier to identify during testing.
      ⏱ 119 ms

  Q 9: What tests exist and how do you run them?
   A: You can test your setup by running the command npm run db:init-
       supabase to initialize and check your database connection.
       To verify the server is ready, the setup script
       automatically checks for the existence of the server file.
       You can also test your Telegram bot by sending it a start
       message or send a test webhook to your Voiceflow endpoint
       using a curl command. Finally, you can monitor real-time
       performance and errors through the function logs in your
       Vercel dashboard.
      ⏱ 106 ms

  Q10: What environment variables or config files are required?
   A: To set up the system, you must have a .env file containing your
       specific configuration values. The required environment
       variables include your Telegram Bot Token, VoiceFlow API
       Key, and VoiceFlow Webhook Secret. For the database to
       work, you also need to provide your Supabase URL and
       Service Role Key. If you are deploying to Vercel, you will
       need to set these same variables in the Vercel dashboard
       along with a database connection string.
      ⏱ 80 ms

  Q11: What are the main classes or components and what do they do?
   A: The main component is a Database Manager class that handles
       connections and operations for a Supabase database. This
       class is responsible for saving and retrieving user notes,
       including details like emotion scores and content types. It
       also manages therapy session data, such as session
       duration, mood changes, and key insights. Additionally, the
       system includes a server configuration that routes web
       traffic for services like Telegram and Voiceflow.
